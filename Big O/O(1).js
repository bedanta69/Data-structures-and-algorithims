//O(1) refers to constant time
//It reffers that number of operations will be constant regardless of the size of the data
//if numbers of operations is 1 then the time complexity is O(1) if its 2 then O(2) and so on
//O(1) gives a line parallel to the x axis in the graph of elements to no of operations
